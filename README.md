# homeserver
I wanted to make a home-page for a personal home server, with content categorization. The idea is to have category blobs which host link-blobs to individual self-hosted services, Instead of having a standard, boring list layout and because I kinda liked the idea visually.
Also I wanted to refresh my Vue knowledge a bit.
